/**
 * CHANGELOG guard — runs as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook on Bash commands.
 *
 * The CHANGELOG is the spine of the release pipeline (store listing, GitHub
 * release body). This blocks a `git commit` that stages source changes without
 * a matching CHANGELOG.md entry. Skips non-commit commands; allows an explicit
 * `[skip changelog]` bypass for genuinely non-user-facing work (pure
 * refactor/chore). Fails open (exit 0) on any doubt so it never wedges
 * unrelated commands.
 *
 * Hook contract: reads the tool payload as JSON on stdin; exit 2 blocks the
 * tool and shows stderr to the model; any other exit allows it.
